  The goal of life is to contribute as much as a person can to this wonderful world. No matter the impact, it should always positively affect people, as God put as here for something bigger than just ourselves. <p/>
  This website is about documenting what I’ve learned in order for others to see it. This will primarily be about the world of computers, which entails more than enough content. But, I may throw in a few personal life stories or lessons in here. <p/>
  I tend to live in the world of computer security, hacking, cryptography, software development and networking. However, it's hard for me to resistant a new and interesting technology. <p>
  At the core, a few ideas describe me: I’m a problem solver, follower of Christ and energetic. If there’s a problem, I cannot sleep until it has been solved. This can be as simple as an argument with a sibling, a level of Mario or a bug in my code. I love to solve problems not because the problem is important, but figuring out new concepts brings me joy. Secondly, but the most important is that I’m a follower of Jesus Christ. Everything I do is attributed to the big man upstairs. I strive to love the Lord and love others as myself. In the end, these two concepts are the foundation to everything that I believe in. Lastly, I am a fireball of energy. I strive to get people excited to live life! Could be playing baseball, entering a CTF competition or driving across the country...The key to life is living it passionately for all to see. Everything else works out from there!
